    // - launch an alert to tell the user they are about to take a quiz
    // - launch a confirm
    //     - if the user says no, break out of the quiz
        // the word return STOPS any function. nothing gets past a return
    // - get the user's first name
        // - get the user's last name
    // - launch a prompt with a question
    //     - when the users answer question store the answer in variable
    // the problem we have to solve is that users are free to type whatever they want, but we only want a yes or no. We can write a function that reads a user's input and tells us whether it's a yes or a no
    // - evaluate the answer -- compare it to the correct answer
    // if the user said yes, given them a point
        // score++ also works
        // score++ also works
        // score++ also works
    // - finally, display some "results" output in the DOM with the user's name and their score.
